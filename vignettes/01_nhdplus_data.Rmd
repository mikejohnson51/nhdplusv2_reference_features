The R script is used to download and process spatial data related to the National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus) from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

After loading the `config.R` file to set up file structure, the script gets the EPA bucket from S3 and obtains a data.frame listing objects from the EPA bucket. 

It then defines and downloads the core geodatabase for each VPU and extracts the information for catchments, burnlines, flowlines, and water bodies.

These are then written to geopackages using `ogr2ogr`. 

The key outputs and results of running this script are the following:

A set of geopackages for catchments, flowlines,  waterbodies, and burn lines events.
